    "## 2: Regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding exercise hints at a general problem of finding specific patterns in text. A handy tool for this problem is Python's _regular expression library_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _regular expression_ is specially formatted pattern, written as a string. Matching patterns with regular expressions has 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You come up with a pattern to find\n",
    "2. You compile it into a _pattern object_\n",
    "3. You apply the pattern object to a string, to find instances of the pattern within the string\n",

    "It is easiest to see by example. What follows is just a small sample of what is possible with regular expressions in Python; refer to the [regular expression documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html) for many more examples and details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1.** The simplest pattern is text that you wish to match exactly. For instance, suppose you wish to find an instance of the word \"impossible\" in a piece of text. Here is a snippet of Python code to do it.\n",
    "\n",

    "Beyond exact text, there is a rich syntax for specifying complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can use _character classes_ to match both \"Impossible\" and \"impossible\" using the pattern, \"`[Ii]mpossible`\". That is, the characters in square brackets represent the set of all characters that may match at the given position. As another example, you could match any digit using the character class, \"`[0123456789]`\", or the more compact _range_ notation, \"`[0-9]`\". Thus, the pattern, \"`cat[xyz][0-9]hole`\" would match \"catx3hole\" but neither \"catX3hole\" nor \"catxzhole\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also match the _complement_ of a character class set using a caret, \"`^`\", just after the opening square bracket. For instance, \"`cat[a-z][^0-9]hole`\" would match \"catx@hole\" but not \"catx3hole\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some common character classes, which have additional shortcuts. For instance, the special _escaped_ `d`, or `\\d`, will match _any_ digit. So, to match a 7-digit phone number, you might use the pattern, \"`\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d`\".\n",
