    "# CSE 6040, Fall 2015 [01]: Intro to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, you will do a lot of development in the [Python](http://python.org) language. Python is great for rapid prototyping, meaning you can get started quickly. Yet, it's much more than a toy language, and so very practical for industrial use. In fact, Python is one of the 3 main languages in use at Google's _production_ code!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Can you name the other two languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "It also has extensive library support, meaning a lot of the code you will need day-to-day already exists -- you just need to find it, download it (if necessary), and start using it in your own programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, you are looking at an [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/). An IPython notebook is a document that mixes text, code, and code output. It's a little bit different than running Python from an interpreter command-line, which you may have done at the [MS Analytics Python 101 Bootcamp](https://piazza.com/class/id5sef06fsf46v?cid=7). We will use them for in-class exercises because, from a teaching and learning point of view, it's a great way to create structured, self-documenting worksheets that you can play with and revise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to introduce you to how IPython notebooks work and practice writing some Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: For a different tutorial, refer to the [one included in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html) or the MSA Python 101 Boot Camp (see above)."

    "## Concept 0: Expressions, identifiers, and (assignment) statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic building block of any Python program is an _expression_. A Python expression is just like a mathematical expression: it's a snippet of values and operations that, when executed, produce a value.\n",

    "* An integer value: `3`\n",
    "* A floating-point (\"real\") value: `3.0`\n",

    "\n",
    "A _function_ is similar to the same concept from mathematics: it produces some output, given one or more inputs.\n",

    "And just like a mathematical function, Python distinguishes between the _definition_ of a function from its _use_. To understand how functions work, it's helpful to see definitions and uses together.\n",

    "The following program defines a function named `square` that, given an input value $k$, computes its square, $k^2$. It then uses that function to compute $5^4$, which is of course equal to $(5^2)^2 = 625$, or two sequential uses of `square`."

    "Some things to observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each statement within the _body_ of `square` is indented. The Python language requires that you do this, to indicate both the beginning and the end of the function's definition. (The end occurs at the next line that is _not_ indented.)\n",
    "* Following the function definition, there is an assignment statement whose right-hand side consists of two uses of the function, or two _function calls_. The form suggests that a function call is in fact a certain kind of expression.\n",
    "* Procedurally, the function call transfers control of the program to the function definition, with the arguments at the definition replaced by the values given at the _call site_, which is the location of the call.\n",
    "* Since the function call is an expression, it must take some value when the call is complete. The `return` statement within the function's definition tells you what that value is.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about functions is that any identifiers assigned within its body are _local_ to the body. That is, when a function is called (executed), it cannot normally replace the value of an identifier that was assigned _outside_ the function.\n",
